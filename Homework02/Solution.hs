-- Question 1
-- Add the type signatures for the functions below and then remove the comments and try to compile.

f1 :: Double -> Double -> Double -> Double
f1 x y z = x ** (y/z)

f2 :: Double -> Double -> Double -> Double
f2 x y z = sqrt (x/y - z)

f3 :: Bool -> Bool -> [Bool]
f3 x y = [x == True] ++ [y]

f5 :: String -> String -> String -> Bool
f5 x y z = x == (y ++ z)

-- Question 2
-- Why should we define type signatures of functions? How can they help you? How can they help others?

-- Type signatures place restrictions on your data and can help you to catch errors you make in your code. Also
-- you can develop your programs by first defining the function's types, which sets the data transformation
-- flow. After that, it's easier to implement the functions.
-- They also help other developers (and your self) to better understand your code.

-- Question 3
-- Why should you define type signatures for variables? How can they help you?

-- In Haskell we ussually declare variables inside functions. We mostly do no use type signatures for them. But in the
-- begining when you are getting errors it is helpful to add the signatures to all of your variables because the error
-- from the compiler can become more understandable if you do this.

-- Question 4
-- Are there any functions in Haskell that let you transform one type to the other? Try googling for the answer.

-- We can use the function `show` to transform almost any type into String (we'll learn specifically which types in the type classes lesson):

v1 :: Float
v1 = 1.23

v2 :: String
v2 = show v1

-- You can also convert a `Double` to an `Int` with the round function (although, you're loosing information).
v4 = 3.1415 :: Double
v5 = round v4 :: Int

-- Question 5
-- Can you also define in Haskell list of lists? Did we showed any example of that? How would you access the inner
-- most elements?

-- Yes you can and yes we did. When we used the function words and lines we got a list of strings and a string is 
-- also a list of characters. Here is an example:
listOfLists :: [String]
listOfLists = ["abc","def","ghi"]

v6 :: Char
v6 = listOfLists !! 1 !! 2
