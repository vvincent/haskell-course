-- Question 1
-- Rewrite the following code below that used do-notation to equivalent code that does not use do-notation. 

ioExample :: IO ()
ioExample = do
  print "Input number:"
  string <- getLine
  let n = read string
      add1 x = x + 1
  print (add1 n)
  
ioExample' :: IO () 
ioExample' = 
  print "Input number:" >>
    getLine >>= 
      (\string ->
        return ((\n -> 
                  (\add1 -> 
                    (add1 n)
                  ) (\x -> x + 1)
                ) (read string)
               )
      ) >>= 
      print

-- Question 2
-- Define the <$> and <*> operatorns with help of monad operators in a do-notation. 
-- You can call them liftM and ap operators.

liftM :: (Monad m) => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
liftM f m1 = do 
    x1 <- m1
    return (f x1)

ap :: (Monad m) => m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
ap m1 m2 = do 
    f <- m1
    x2 <- m2
    return (f x2) 

-- Question 3
-- Write a function that takes in n of type Int and returns a list of type [Int]. The elements of the list
-- are combination counts for lists [1 .. x] where x goes from 1 to n. So the fisrt combination count is for
-- the list [1], the second for the list [1,2] and the last for the list [1..n]. 

-- How to compute a combination count for a list: e.g. the list [1,2] has 4 possible combinations which are: 
-- (1,1) (1,2) (2,1) and (2,2). Do not use your knowledge of mathematics. Do it by computing all combination 
-- pairs and counting them. Use list comprehension to help yourself. 

combinationCount :: Int -> [Int]
combinationCount n = do 
    let combForOne x = length $ [(y1,y2) | y1 <- [1..x], y2 <- [1..x]]
    if n < 0 then [] 
    else [combForOne i | i <- [1..n]]

-- Question 4
-- If you succesfully computed the function from Question 2 you should get for n = 5 the list
-- [1,4,9,16,25] which clearly represents the function f(x) = x**2. Write now a function that uses the
-- fittingFunc defined below and finds the best exponent a from the input list of type [Double] that fits 
-- the function f(x) = x**2. So for instance for [1.5, 1.6 .. 2.5] it should return 2.0. Your fitting 
-- check should be done by calculating the mean squared error: (x - x1)^2 + ... + (x - xn)^2
