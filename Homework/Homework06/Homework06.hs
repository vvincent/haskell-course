-- Question 1
-- Write a version of the product function without using pattern matching.


-- Question 2
-- Write a function that takes in a list of integers and removes from it the smallest
-- element. If the element is occuring more then once, it should remove only the first
-- occurence of the smallest element.

-- Chalange: Write the this function in such a way that if you add some code to it and
-- not remove any, the function will be removing all instances of the smallest eleement.


-- Question 3
-- Write a function that takes in an integer n, calculates the factorial n! and 
-- returns a string in the form of 1*2* ... *n = n! where n! is the actual result. 


-- Question 4
-- Write your own version of functions zip and zipWith. Use pattern matching.

-- zip [1..3] [3..1]
-- returns: [(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)]

-- zipWith (+) [1,2,3] [1,2,3]
-- returns: [2,4,6]
